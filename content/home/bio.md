I did my PhD at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en) in Lausanne, working on methods for text mining and citation analysis of scholarly publications. During my PhD, I co-founded [Odoma](https://www.odoma.ch), a start-up offering customised machine learning solutions for the cultural heritage sector. 

Prior to joining the University of Amsterdam, I have been part of the [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering) of The Alan Turing Institute, also as a co-investigator on the [Living with Machines](http://livingwithmachines.ac.uk) project. I have been a researcher at Leiden University, the Leibniz Institute of European History in Mainz, the University of Oxford. My background is in computer science (BSc) and history (BA, MA).

I am affiliated with the [Media Studies department](https://www.uva.nl/en/discipline/media-studies/media-studies.html) of the University of Amsterdam, a member of [Creative Amsterdam (CREATE)](https://www.create.humanities.uva.nl)) and the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)](https://www.illc.uva.nl). As a visiting researcher, I convene the [AI for Arts](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/ai-arts) interest group at the Turing, and I am part of the [Quantitative Science Studies](https://www.cwts.nl/research/research-groups/quantitative-science-studies) group at CWTS.
