I did my PhD at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en) in Lausanne, working on methods for text mining and citation analysis of scholarly publications. During my PhD, I co-founded [Odoma](https://www.odoma.ch), a start-up offering customised machine learning solutions for the cultural heritage sector. 

Prior to joining the University of Amsterdam, I have been part of the [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering) at The Alan Turing Institute, also as a co-investigator on the [Living with Machines](http://livingwithmachines.ac.uk) project. Previously, I have been a researcher at Leiden University, the Leibniz Institute of European History in Mainz, the University of Oxford. My background is in computer science (BSc), history and information studies (BA, MA).

I am affiliated with the department of [Media Studies](https://www.uva.nl/en/discipline/media-studies/media-studies.html) at the University of Amsterdam, a member of [Creative Amsterdam](https://www.create.humanities.uva.nl) (CREATE) and the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl) (ILLC). I am a visiting researcher at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) (UK) and at the [Centre for Science and Technology Studies](https://www.cwts.nl) (CWTS), Leiden University (NL); a visiting professor at the [University of Bologna's Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre](https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en) (IT).
