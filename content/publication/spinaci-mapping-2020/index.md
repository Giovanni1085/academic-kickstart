abstract: "Maps of research could provide key insights in the current and future development of the digital humanities. Two obstacles to this end are the definition of what can be considered digital humanities research in the first place, and the mostly unknown coverage of digital humanities publications in citation indexes. In view of addressing these challenges, we release a list of digital humanities journals developed via an iterative approach combining manual curation with citation data. Based on this list, we further assess the journal article coverage of Web of Science, Scopus, Crossref and Dimensions. We find that Crossref has the best coverage of exclusively digital humanities journals, while Dimensions has the best coverage of related journals. Furthermore, we use Dimensions data to map digital humanities research via a directed citation network, finding connections with fields such as computational linguistics and digital libraries, and a strong correlation between journals and citation clusters."
