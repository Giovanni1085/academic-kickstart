I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the **[University of Bologna](https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en)** and a co-founder at **[Odoma](https://www.odoma.ch)**.

I primarily work on **Machine Learning applications in the Arts and Humanities**. I am also interested in **using data to study cultural and social phenomena**, including the human past, the arts market, open science, and Wikipedia.
