I am a Professor at the [Department of Communication](https://comm.ku.dk/), in the Faculty of Humanities, University of Copenhagen. In Bologna, I am affiliated with the [Department of Classical and Italian Philology](https://ficlit.unibo.it/it), and the [Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre](https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en).

I did my PhD at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en) in Lausanne, working on methods for text mining and citation analysis of humanities scholarly publications. It is during my PhD that I co-founded [Odoma](https://www.odoma.ch) with my friend [Laurent Bolli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurentbolli/): we provide customised AI solutions for the cultural and creative sectors.

Prior to joining the University of Bologna, I have been part of the [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering) at The Alan Turing Institute, and an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam, [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)](https://www.illc.uva.nl/). My background is in computer science (BSc), history and information studies (BA, MA).
