During this academic year, I teach the following courses (in chronological order):

* **Semantic digital libraries** (MA/MSc, University of Bologna)

* Course website: https://www.unibo.it/en/study/phd-professional-masters-specialisation-schools-and-other-programmes/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2024/424786.

*Libraries have always been an inspiration for the standards and technologies of the Semantic Web, and the application of artificial intelligence. At the end of the course the students will learn how to manage the process related to the creation of a digital library: from the metadata choice to the ontologies selection; from the network issues to the architecture implementation; from the preservation of data to the curation of the life cycle of digital cultural objects. Roughly half of the course will be devoted to semantic web technologies in digital libraries, while the other half of the course will focus on new semantic services powered by Artificial Intelligence.*

* **Machine Learning for the Humanities** (MA/MSc, University of Bologna)

* Course website: https://www.unibo.it/en/study/phd-professional-masters-specialisation-schools-and-other-programmes/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2024/490903.

*This course offers an introduction to Machine Learning (ML) and an overview of recent trends in ML applications in the Arts and Humanities. The course consists of classes introducing foundational ML concepts and methods, and significant time spent on developing a variety of ML applications with PyTorch.*
