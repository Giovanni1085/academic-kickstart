During this academic year, I teach the following courses (in chronological order):

* **Semantic digital libraries** (MA/MSc, University of Bologna)

* Course website: https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2023/424786.

*Libraries have always been an inspiration for the standards and technologies of the semantic web, and the application of artificial intelligence. At the end of the course the students will learn how to manage the process related to the creation of a digital library: from the metadata choice to the ontologies selection; from the network issues to the architecture implementation; from the preservation of data to the curation of the life cycle of digital cultural objects. Roughly half of the course will be devoted to semantic web technologies in digital libraries, while the other half of the course will focus on new semantic services powered by artificial intelligence technologies.*

* **Introduction to Programming** (MA/MSc, University of Bologna)

* Course website: https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2023/490581.

*Coding skills are increasingly in demand: they enable us to develop the appropriate applications for processing and analyzing linguistic data, at scale. This course teaches foundational coding skills using Python, a popular programming language. The skills acquired during the course will enable students to get the most out of several more advanced courses in the program.*

*The practical goal is to show students 1) when and how it is possible and advisable to automate a task or analyze data programmatically; 2) how to develop custom applications, rather than only relying on ready-made ones. To this end, the course introduces foundational programming concepts (variables, data types, flow control, functions, input/output), specific techniques and resources for linguistics (strings, regular expressions, text files), and useful extensions focused on data analysis and visualization, numerical manipulation, Web crawling, and API querying.*

* **Machine Learning for the Humanities** (MA/MSc, University of Bologna)

* Course website: https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2023/499860.

*This seminar offers an overview of recent trends in Machine Learning (ML) applications in the Arts and Humanities. The seminar will consist of a few classes introducing foundational ML concepts and methods, while most of the remaining classes will focus on diverse areas of the Arts and Humanities and discuss related ML applications. The students will be asked to prepare in advance of classes, by reading the proposed literature and engaging in discussion.*
