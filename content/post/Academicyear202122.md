During this academic year, I teach the following courses (in chronological order):

* **Semantic digital libraries** (MA/MSc, University of Bologna)

* Course website: https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2022/424786.

*Libraries have always been an inspiration for the standards and technologies of the semantic web, and the application of artificial intelligence. At the end of the course the students will learn how to manage the process related to the creation of a digital library: from the metadata choice to the ontologies selection; from the network issues to the architecture implementation; from the preservation of data to the curation of the life cycle of digital cultural objects. Roughly half of the course will be devoted to semantic web technologies in digital libraries, while the other half of the course will focus on new semantic services powered by artificial intelligence technologies.*

* **AI for society** (BSc, with Tobias Blanke)

* Course repository (previous year's edition): https://github.com/Giovanni1085/UvA_AIforSociety_2021.

*AI is rapidly becoming part of our daily lives in many visible and invisible ways. Consequently, the social sciences and humanities are increasingly contributing to dominant research problems in AI. Examples include the ethical profiling of AI systems, including their privacy and governance, questions of fairness and accountability, as well as data bias and model interpretability. This course provides an opportunity to engage with these increasingly mainstream research questions. It does so by proposing a pathway into the main critical themes emerging when AI is applied in real-world scenarios, and it does so by highlighting the bi-directional contributions of the social sciences and humanities.*

* **Digital Humanities Laboratory** (BA)

*In this laboratory course students engage with a digital humanities project. Students will be able to work on a real-world research project in collaboration with a team or work independently on a topic of choice. A list of projects will be provided, but the students are encouraged to propose their own. The purpose of the laboratory is to allow the students to engage in a larger piece of work autonomously, pulling together the concepts, experience and skills learned through the rest of the track. The students will be encouraged to cross the boundaries between previous courses, and to relate their project results within the broader context of the program.*
