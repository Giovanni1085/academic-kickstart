Dear student, if you are enrolled at the University of Amsterdam or the Amsterdam University College, and you would like to do a project/thesis/capstone with me, these are a few topics I or members of my team are interested into. If you like one of them, or you would like to propose something else, get in touch: <g.colavizza@uva.nl> (please include program, year and grades). 

## AI for cultural heritage

There are a variety of topics under this general theme which are of interest, as heritage collections have been widely digitized over recent years. Themes include the use of **active learning** to annotate and retrieve information (this is related to human-AI interaction or hybrid AI), the use of **transfer learning** (for example language models of virual features), the **automated enrichment of collections** via information extraction (for example, named entity recognition and linking).

Several of these topics are developed within the context of the [Creative Amsterdam initiative](https://www.create.humanities.uva.nl/ai-for-cultural-heritage/) (CREATE) at UvA, and in collaboration with the main Dutch heritage organizations. 

To know more: Fiorucci et al., *[Machine Learning for Cultural Heritage: A Survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865520300532)*, 2020. 

## Computational art history

The availability of digitized (or born-digital) art collections allows scholars to **use modern machine learning techniques to study artistic influences, styles and visual patterns recurring over time**. 

To know more: Shen et al., *[Discovering Visual Patterns in Art Collections with Spatially-consistent Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02678)*, 2019.

## Crypto art market prediction

Crypto art is born-digital art tokenized and exchanged on blockchains, typically Ethereum. Crypto art is currently growing very rapidly, and is at the forefront of experimentation on many art-related questions. Many project ideas can focus on crypto art, and in particular on **predicting art prices using a variety of signals** (both for first sales and for re-sales). If you are into machine learning and finance, this project is for you.

## The language of science

How scientists use natural language to communicate? How does their use differs across disciplines (say, mathematics and philosophy)? This projects aims at **measuring the relative difference or similarity in the use of natural language across scientific communities** and over time.

## Public understanding of science (case study on COVID-19)

Scientific results are increasingly communicated and debated publicly, they are mediatized. This happens via **traditional media** (e.g., newspapers), **online media** (e.g., Wikipedia), **social media** (e.g., Twitter). Understanding how these debates happen and how scientific results are framed (and by whom) is very important to **clarify how science is perceived and understood**. Projects here can combine several data sources to further our understanding of this topic.

Work on **COVID-19-related research** is of particular interest.

## AI for science (case study on COVID-19)

Under this general umbrella there are many exciting opportunities which consists in the application of machine learning to improve scientific communication. Examples include the **modelling of citations** (citation intention, reliability), the **extraction of structured information** from scientific literature, the **automatic summarization of scientific articles** and **representation learning of experts and expertise**. 

Work on **COVID-19-related research** is of particular interest.
