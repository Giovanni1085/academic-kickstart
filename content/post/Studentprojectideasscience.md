If you are enrolled at the University of Bologna, and you would like to do a project/thesis/capstone with me, these are a few topics I or members of my team are interested into. 

If you like one of them, or you would like to propose something else, get in touch: <giovanni.colavizza@unibo.it> (please include program, year and grades). 

**Participation in shared tasks is very encouraged**. Students from previous years have participated, for example, in challenges such as [SemEval 2020 unsupervised lexical semantic change](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20948) (task 1) and [CLEF HIPE 2020](https://impresso.github.io/CLEF-HIPE-2020) (Named Entity Recognition and Linking on multilingual historical corpora).

## AI for cultural heritage

There are a variety of topics under this general theme which are of interest, as heritage collections have been widely digitized over recent years. Themes include the use of **active learning** to annotate and retrieve information (this is related to human-AI interaction or hybrid AI), the use of **transfer learning** (for example language models of virual features), the **automated enrichment of collections** via information extraction (for example, named entity recognition and linking), and the application of **explainable AI** methods to automated tasks in cultural or creative workflows.

To know more: Fiorucci et al., *[Machine Learning for Cultural Heritage: A Survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865520300532)*, 2020. 

## Computational art history

The availability of digitized (or born-digital) art collections allows scholars to **use modern machine learning techniques to study artistic influences, styles and visual patterns recurring over time**. This also includes buidling large-scale image retrieval systems for art collections.

To know more: Shen et al., *[Discovering Visual Patterns in Art Collections with Spatially-consistent Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02678)*, 2019.

## Large Language Models (LLM)

LLMs like ChatGPT are becomign widely used. I am interested in theses focusing on the definition, development, and testing of **personalized LLMs from open source models** in sectors related to the Arts & Humanities. These include, for example, law, tenders, public administration, cultural heritage and GLAM.

To know more: 
* *[A Survey of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223)*, 2023.
* *[RAG vs Fine-tuning: Pipelines, Tradeoffs, and a Case Study on Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08406)*, 2024.
* *[Lawyering in the Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4626276)*, 2023.

## Industry internships

These projects are suitable for students with a strong background in AI and an interest in cultural heritage, the creative industries, and LLMs. Please, if you do not have the required background, refrain from applying. Projects might be compensated as part of contracts via the consulting company [Odoma](https://www.odoma.ch).
