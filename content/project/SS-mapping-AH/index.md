The Arts & Humanities are a wide and multifaceted set of disciplines, with many research interests. To date, **a map of Arts & Humanities research** does not exist: we seek to create one and use it to understand how the Arts & Humanities organise socially and intellectually, and how new knowledge develops in these disciplines.
