NFT Art is **digital art tokenized and exchanged using blockchains, as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**. This new way of exchanging artworks and collectibles is bringing many innovations to the arts market, for example artist royalties on re-sales. Check out the [SuperRare gallery](https://superrare.co) for some examples.

I am primarily interested in **understanding how the NFT Art market operates**, and what social ipact it is having on artists and collectors, using a combination of data science and ethnography methods. I am also looking into **developing AI tools for NFT Art, including price prediction and artwork recommender systems**.
