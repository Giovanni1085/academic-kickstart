Gallery, Library, Archival, and Museum collections contain large troves of visual and textual information. Their digitisation is opening up new opportunities to automatically extract contents and create knowledge graphs. Machine learning methods need to be adapted to the task, since challenges include input noise, source and domain variety, lack of linguistic resources. This open-ended project aims to **design, develop and test machine learning methods for the automatic extraction of information for GLAM collections**. 

Methodologies of interest also include *transfer learning*, to re-use existing resources, *active learning*, to leverage expert knowledge while training models, and *eXplainable AI*, to open models to human inspection and understanding.
