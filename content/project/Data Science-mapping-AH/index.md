The Arts & Humanities are a wide and multifaceted set of disciplines, with many research interests. To date, **a comprehensive map of Arts & Humanities research** does not exist: we seek to create one and use it to understand how the Arts & Humanities organise socially and intellectually, and how new knowledge develops in these disciplines. 

Our current focus is on mapping **Digital Humanities** research, and understanding how it relates to other areas of scientific knowledge.
