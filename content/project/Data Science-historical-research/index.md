This line of research focuses on a variety of topics whereby the data science toolkit is put at the service of a humanities research question. Examples of recent topics include historical epidemics, apprenticeship and knowledge tramsmission, migratory patterns in early modern Venice. I am happy to collaborate on a variety of new topics: please reach out if interested.
