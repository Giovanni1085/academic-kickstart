Textual historical collections have undergone large-scale digitisation campaigns making a wealth of data available for researchers. Most of these texts have been extracted using automated means, via **Handwritten Text Recognition or Optical Character Recognition (HTR/OCR)**. Such extraction is notoriously error-prone and thus has a largely unknown impact on the use of texts, for example for information extraction and text analysis. This project aims to systematically assess such impact and establish empirical guidelines to answer the following practical questions: **When is HTR/OCR quality good enough?**, **How can it be improved?**
