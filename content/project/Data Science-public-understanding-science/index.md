Science is increasingly debated publicly. A variety of media interact in this respect: traditional media (newspapers), online media (Wikipedia), social media (Twitter), and more. **The goal of this project is to better understand how science is communicated across media, how it is publicly debated, and what role scientists and scholars play in this respect.** Ultimately, we seek to also understand how the mediatization of science is influencing science communication in itself. An important focus of this project are the **COVID-19 pandemic** and **Wikipedia**.

This project is conducted in collaboration with, among others, [Bob West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west), [Rodrigo Costas](https://www.cwts.nl/people/rodrigocostas) and the [Wikimedia Foundation Research team](https://research.wikimedia.org).
