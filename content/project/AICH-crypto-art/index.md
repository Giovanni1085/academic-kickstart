Crypto art is **born-digital art tokenized and exchanged using blockchains**, typically Ethereum. This triving artistic movement is at the forefront of innovations in art markets which will likely spread to the traditional systems in due course. Check the [SuperRare gallery](https://superrare.co) out for some examples.

Considering crypto art, I am primarily interested in **understanding and predicting the market** using machine learning techniques, from artwork prices (both primary and secondary sales) to the valuation of entire collections. I am also interested in studying the culture and artistic influences of this movement using ethnography.
